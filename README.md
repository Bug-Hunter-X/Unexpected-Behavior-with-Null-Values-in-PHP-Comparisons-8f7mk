This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in PHP related to loose comparisons and null values.  The `bug.php` file contains a function that compares two values.  However, when null is passed as an argument, PHP's loose comparison behavior leads to unexpected outputs and warnings.  The `bugSolution.php` file presents a solution that addresses this issue using strict comparison and null checks.
